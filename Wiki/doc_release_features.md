# Configuration
in order to use mail sending feature, you need to configure the following settings in the `azot-backend/azot/settings.py`
```python
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your email'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your email password or app password'
```
without this configuration, you will not be able to activate users account or reset their password. You can contact me for more information on how to configure this feature.
